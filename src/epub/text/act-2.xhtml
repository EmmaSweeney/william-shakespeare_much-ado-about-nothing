			<h2><b>ACT II</b></h2>
<h3><b>SCENE I. A hall in Leonato’s house.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc">
      Enter <span class="charname">Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice</span> and
      others.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Was not Count John here at supper?
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      I saw him not.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am
      heart-burned an hour after.
    </p>
<p>
      HERO.<br/>
      He is of a very melancholy disposition.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way
      between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing;
      and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s
      mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s
      face—
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his
      purse, such a man would win any woman in the world if a’ could get
      her good will.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou
      be so shrewd of thy tongue.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      In faith, she’s too curst.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God’s sending
      that way; for it is said, ‘God sends a curst cow short horns;’
      but to a cow too curst he sends none.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at
      him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a
      husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him
      my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he
      that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is
      not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I
      will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes
      into hell.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Well then, go you into hell?
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      No; but to the gate; and there will the Devil meet me, like an
      old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, ‘Get you to heaven,
      Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.’ So
      deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens: he shows me
      where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      [<i>To Hero</i>.] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Yes, faith; it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy,
      and say, ‘Father, as it please you:’— but yet for all
      that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another
      curtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please me.’
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it
      not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust? to
      make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll
      none: Adam’s sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to
      match in my kindred.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Daughter, remember what I told you: if the Prince do solicit you
      in that kind, you know your answer.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in
      good time: if the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in
      everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing,
      wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace:
      the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
      fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest, as a measure, full of state and
      ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and with his bad legs, falls into
      the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      I have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.

      Lady, will you walk about with your friend?

      I know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio.

<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      At a word, I am not.
    </p>
<p>

      I know you by the waggling of your head.

<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
    </p>
<p>
      URSULA.<br/>
      You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very
      man. Here’s his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      At a word, I am not.
    </p>
<p>
      URSULA.<br/>
      Come, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent
      wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will
      appear, and there’s an end.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Will you not tell me who told you so?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      No, you shall pardon me.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Nor will you not tell me who you are?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Not now.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of
      the ‘Hundred Merry Tales.’ Well, this was Signior
      Benedick that said so.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      What’s he?
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      I am sure you know him well enough.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Not I, believe me.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Did he never make you laugh?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      I pray you, what is he?
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Why, he is the Prince’s jester: a very dull fool; only his
      gift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in
      him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villainy; for he
      both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him.
      I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me!
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Do, do: he’ll but break a comparison or two on me; which,
      peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy;
      and then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
      supper that night. [<i>Music within</i>.] We must follow the leaders.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      In every good thing.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.

      Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her
      father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one visor
      remains.

      DON JOHN.<br/>
      Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is
      enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no equal for
      his birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it.

      Even to the next willow, about your own business, Count. What
      fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer’s
      chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant’s scarf? You must wear
      it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.

      Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am
      apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter
      disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives

      Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see him?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him
      here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told
      him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I
      offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as
      being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      To be whipped! What’s his fault?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      The flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy’d
      with finding a bird’s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals
      it.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland
      too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have
      bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird’s nest.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that
      danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with
      one green leaf on it would have answered her: my very visor began to
      assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
      myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a
      great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon
      me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me.
      She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible
      as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to
      the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all
      that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made
      Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire
      too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good
      apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly,
      while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and
      people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so indeed, all
      disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.

      Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.

<p>

      Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for
      it, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me

      Neither, my lord.

      The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but
      civil Count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I’ll
      be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed
      in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his
      good will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his
      Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it!
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Speak, Count, ’tis your cue.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy,

      In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.

      No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days:
      your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your
      Grace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
    </p>
<p>

      Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you;
      for out of question, you were born in a merry hour.

<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star
      danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!

      By my troth, a pleasant spirited lady.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord:
      she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have
      heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
      herself with laughing.
    </p>
<p>

      She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

      O! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.

      She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

      Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night;
      and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant
      thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim
      undertake one of Hercules’ labours, which is, to bring Signior
      Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with
      the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion
      it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you
      direction.

      My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights’

      I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good
      husband.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus
      far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and
      confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
      shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so
      practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy
      stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is
      no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only
      love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

      Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
    </p>
<p>
      DON JOHN.<br/>
      Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I
      am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection
      ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall
      appear in me.
    </p>
<p>
      DON JOHN.<br/>
      Show me briefly how.
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the
      favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
    </p>
<p>
      DON JOHN.<br/>
      I remember.
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to
      look out at her lady’s chamber window.
    </p>
<p>
      DON JOHN.<br/> What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince
      your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in
      marrying the renowned Claudio,—whose estimation do you mightily hold
      up,—to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
    </p>
<p>
      DON JOHN.<br/>
      What proof shall I make of that?
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero,
      and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?
    </p>
<p>
      DON JOHN.<br/>
      Only to despite them, I will endeavour anything.
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count
      Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind
      of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as—in love of your brother’s
      honour, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who
      is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,—that you have
      discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them
      instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her
      chamber window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio;
      and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for
      in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent;
      and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty, that
      jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.
    </p>
<p>
      DON JOHN.<br/>
      Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be
      cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.

      I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when
      he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such
      shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling
      in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music
      with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor
      and the pipe: I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see
      a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion
      of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an
      honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his words are
      a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so
      converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
      be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I’ll take my
      oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such
      a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well;
      another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one
      woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain;
      wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair,
      or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not
      I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair
      shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I
      will hide me in the arbour.

      ’Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: ‘Shall I,’

      have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.

      O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
      Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?

      That.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at
      herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew
      would flout her: ‘I measure him,’ says she, ‘by my own
      spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him,
      I should.’

      tears her hair, prays, curses; ‘O sweet Benedick! God give me
      patience!’
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so
      much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a
      desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.
    </p>
<p>

      LEONATO.<br/>
      Were it good, think you?
    </p>
<p>

      Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he
      love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will
      die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed
      crossness.

      She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, ’tis
      very possible he’ll scorn it; for the man,—as you know all,—hath a
      contemptible spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      He is a very proper man.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      ’Fore God, and in my mind, very wise.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      And I take him to be valiant.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you
      may say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion, or
      undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      If he do fear God, a’ must necessarily keep peace: if he
      break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it
      seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for
      your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Nay, that’s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool
      the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly
      examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      [<i>Aside</i>] If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
      trust my expectation.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      [<i>Aside</i>] Let there be the same net spread for her; and
      that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be,
      when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such
      matter: that’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a
      dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

      BENEDICK.<br/>
      [<i>Advancing from the arbour.</i>] This can be no trick: the
      conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They
      seem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have their full bent. Love
      me? why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will
      bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too
      that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never
      think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their
      detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair:
      ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: ’tis so,
      I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no
      addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be
      horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants
      of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but
      doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he
      cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper
      bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the
      world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think
      I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she’s
      a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.
    </p>
<p class="scenedesc">
      Enter <span class="charname">Beatrice</span>.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
      thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      You take pleasure then in the message?
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point,
      and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.
    </p>

      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Ha! ‘Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to
      dinner,’ there’s a double meaning in that. ‘I took no
      more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me,’ that’s
      as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If
      I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a
      Jew. I will go get her picture.

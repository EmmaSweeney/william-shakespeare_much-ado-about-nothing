			<h2><b>ACT V</b></h2>
<h3><b>SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc">
      Enter <span class="charname">Leonato</span> and <span class="charname">Antonio</span>.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      If you go on thus, you will kill yourself<br/>
      And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief<br/>
      Against yourself.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      I pray thee, cease thy counsel,<br/>
      Which falls into mine ears as profitless<br/>
      As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;<br/>
      Nor let no comforter delight mine ear<br/>
      But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine:<br/>
      Bring me a father that so lov’d his child,<br/>
      Whose joy of her is overwhelm’d like mine,<br/>
      And bid him speak of patience;<br/>
      Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,<br/>
      And let it answer every strain for strain,<br/>
      As thus for thus and such a grief for such,<br/>
      In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:<br/>
      If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard;<br/>
      Bid sorrow wag, cry ‘hem’ when he should groan,<br/>
      Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk<br/>
      With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,<br/>
      And I of him will gather patience.<br/>
      But there is no such man; for, brother, men<br/>
      Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief<br/>
      Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,<br/>
      Their counsel turns to passion, which before<br/>
      Would give preceptial medicine to rage,<br/>
      Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,<br/>
      Charm ache with air and agony with words.<br/>
      No, no; ’tis all men’s office to speak patience<br/>
      To those that wring under the load of sorrow,<br/>
      But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency<br/>
      To be so moral when he shall endure<br/>
      The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:<br/>
      My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      Therein do men from children nothing differ.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      I pray thee peace! I will be flesh and blood;<br/>
      For there was never yet philosopher<br/>
      That could endure the toothache patiently,<br/>
      However they have writ the style of gods<br/>
      And made a push at chance and sufferance.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;<br/>
      Make those that do offend you suffer too.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      There thou speak’st reason: nay, I will do so.<br/>
      My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;<br/>
      And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince,<br/>
      And all of them that thus dishonour her.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.
    </p>
<p class="scenedesc">
      Enter <span class="charname">Don Pedro</span> and <span class="charname">Claudio</span>.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Good den, good den.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Good day to both of you.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Hear you, my lords,—
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      We have some haste, Leonato.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:<br/>
      Are you so hasty now?—well, all is one.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      If he could right himself with quarrelling,<br/>
      Some of us would lie low.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Who wrongs him?
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou.<br/>
      Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;<br/>
      I fear thee not.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Marry, beshrew my hand,<br/>
      If it should give your age such cause of fear.<br/>
      In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me:<br/>
      I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,<br/>
      As, under privilege of age, to brag<br/>
      What I have done being young, or what would do,<br/>
      Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,<br/>
      Thou hast so wrong’d mine innocent child and me<br/>
      That I am forc’d to lay my reverence by,<br/>
      And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,<br/>
      Do challenge thee to trial of a man.<br/>
      I say thou hast belied mine innocent child:<br/>
      Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,<br/>
      And she lies buried with her ancestors;<br/>
      O! in a tomb where never scandal slept,<br/>
      Save this of hers, fram’d by thy villainy!
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      My villainy?
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      You say not right, old man,
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      My lord, my lord,<br/> I’ll prove it on his body, if he dare,<br/>
      Despite his nice fence and his active practice,<br/>
      His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Away! I will not have to do with you.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill’d my child;<br/>
      If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:<br/>
      But that’s no matter; let him kill one first:<br/>
      Win me and wear me; let him answer me.<br/>
      Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me.<br/>
      Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence;<br/>
      Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Brother,—
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      Content yourself. God knows I lov’d my niece;<br/>
      And she is dead, slander’d to death by villains,<br/>
      That dare as well answer a man indeed<br/>
      As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.<br/>
      Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      Brother Anthony,—
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,<br/>
      And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,<br/>
      Scambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,<br/>
      That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,<br/>
      Go antickly, show outward hideousness,<br/>
      And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,<br/>
      How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;<br/>
      And this is all!
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      But, brother Anthony,—
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      Come, ’tis no matter:<br/>
      Do not you meddle, let me deal in this.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.<br/>
      My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death;<br/>
      But, on my honour, she was charg’d with nothing<br/>
      But what was true and very full of proof.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      My lord, my lord—
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      I will not hear you.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      No? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.—
    </p>
<p>
      ANTONIO.<br/>
      And shall, or some of us will smart for it.

    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Now, signior, what news?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Good day, my lord.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old
      men without teeth.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Leonato and his brother. What think’st thou? Had we
      fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof
      melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      It is in my scabbard; shall I draw it?
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I
      will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast
      mettle enough in thee to kill care.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you charge it
      against me. I pray you choose another subject.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Shall I speak a word in your ear?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      God bless me from a challenge!
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      [<i>Aside to Claudio.</i>] You are a villain, I jest not: I will
      make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me
      right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and
      her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Well I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      What, a feast, a feast?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      I’ faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf’s-head
      and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife’s
      naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
      other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. ‘True,’ says
      she, ‘a fine little one.’ ‘No,’ said I,
      ‘a great wit.’ ‘Right,’ said she, ‘a
      great gross one.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘a good wit.’
      ‘Just,’ said she, ‘it hurts nobody.’ ‘Nay,’
      said I, ‘the gentleman is wise.’ ‘Certain,’
      said she, ‘a wise gentleman.’ ‘Nay,’ said I,
      ‘he hath the tongues.’ ‘That I believe’ said
      she, ‘for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he
      forswore on Tuesday morning: there’s a double tongue; there’s
      two tongues.’ Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy
      particular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast
      the properest man in Italy.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not
      hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man’s daughter
      told us all.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      All, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the
      sensible Benedick’s head?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Yea, and text underneath, ‘Here dwells Benedick the
      married man!’
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to
      your gossip-like humour; you break jests as braggarts do their blades,
      which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
      you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled
      from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For
      my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be
      with him.
    </p>
<p class="right">
      [<i>Exit.</i>]
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      He is in earnest.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      In most profound earnest; and, I’ll warrant you, for
      the love of Beatrice.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      And hath challenged thee?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Most sincerely.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose
      and leaves off his wit!
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such
      a man.
    </p>
<p>

      But, soft you; let me be: pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did
      he not say my brother was fled?

      Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er

      once, you must be looked to.

      Hearken after their offence, my lord.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Officers, what offence have these men done?
    </p>
<p>
      DOGBERRY.<br/>
      Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they
      have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly,
      they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to
      conclude, they are lying knaves.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s
      their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude,
      what you lay to their charge?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth,
      there’s one meaning well suited.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to
      your answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood.
      What’s your offence?
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer: do you hear
      me, and let this Count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what
      your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to
      light; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John
      your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought
      into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero’s garments; how
      you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon
      record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my
      shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation;
      and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      I have drunk poison whiles he utter’d it.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      But did my brother set thee on to this?
    </p>
<p>
      BORACHIO.<br/>
      Yea; and paid me richly for the practice of it.
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      He is compos’d and fram’d of treachery:
      And fled he is upon this villainy.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear<br/>
      In the rare semblance that I lov’d it first.
    </p>
<p>
      DOGBERRY.<br/>
      Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath
      reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to
      specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.

      I thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death:<br/>

      By my soul, nor I:<br/>

      That he’ll enjoin me to.

      That were impossible; but, I pray you both,<br/>
      Possess the people in Messina here<br/>
      How innocent she died; and if your love<br/>
      Can labour aught in sad invention,<br/>
      Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,<br/>
      And sing it to her bones: sing it tonight.<br/>
      Tomorrow morning come you to my house,<br/>
      And since you could not be my son-in-law,<br/>
      Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,<br/>

      O noble sir,<br/>

      For henceforth of poor Claudio.

      Moreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,—
      this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it
      be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
      one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,
      and borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and
      never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s
      sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.

      I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

      Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over
      it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.
    </p>
<p>
      MARGARET.<br/>
      To have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth; it catches.

      MARGARET.<br/>
      And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils, which hit, but hurt not.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I
      pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.
    </p>
<p>
      MARGARET.<br/>
      Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a

<p>
      I mean, in singing: but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the
      first employer of panders, and a whole book full of these quondam
      carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank
      verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self
      in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no
      rime to ‘lady’ but ‘baby’, an innocent rime; for
      ‘scorn,’ ‘horn’, a hard rime; for ‘school’,
      ‘fool’, a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not
      born under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.

<p>
      Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?

<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Yea, signior; and depart when you bid me.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      O, stay but till then!
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      ‘Then’ is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I
      go, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath
      passed between you and Claudio.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath,
      and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible
      is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge,
      and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward.
      And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first
      fall in love with me?
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      For them all together; which maintained so politic a state
      of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with
      them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      ‘Suffer love,’ a good epithet! I do suffer love
      indeed, for I love thee against my will.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite
      it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that
      which my friend hates.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      It appears not in this confession: there’s not one wise
      man among twenty that will praise himself.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of
      good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he
      dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
      widow weeps.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/> And how long is that think you?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum:
      therefore is it most expedient for the wise,—if Don Worm, his conscience,
      find no impediment to the contrary,—to be the trumpet of his own virtues,
      as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear
      witness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin?

<p>

      Very ill.

      A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,<br/>
      Fashion’d to Beatrice.
    </p>
<p>
      HERO.<br/>
      And here’s another,<br/>
      Writ in my cousin’s hand, stolen from her pocket,<br/>
      Containing her affection unto Benedick.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      A miracle! here’s our own hands against our hearts. Come,
      I will have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity.
    </p>
<p>
      BEATRICE.<br/>
      I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon great
      persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a
      consumption.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Peace! I will stop your mouth. [<i>Kisses her.</i>]
    </p>
<p>
      DON PEDRO.<br/>
      How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      I’ll tell thee what, Prince; a college of witcrackers
      cannout flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or
      an epigram? No; if man will be beaten with brains, a’ shall wear
      nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will
      think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it; and
      therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it, for man is a
      giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think
      to have beaten thee; but, in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live
      unbruised, and love my cousin.
    </p>
<p>
      CLAUDIO.<br/>
      I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might
      have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer;
      which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding
      narrowly to thee.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are
      married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels.
    </p>
<p>
      LEONATO.<br/>
      We’ll have dancing afterward.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      First, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad;
      get thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverent than one
      tipped with horn.

      My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,<br/>
      And brought with armed men back to Messina.
    </p>
<p>
      BENEDICK.<br/>
      Think not on him till tomorrow: I’ll devise thee
      brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers!
